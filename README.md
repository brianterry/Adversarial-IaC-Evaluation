# Adversarial IaC Benchmark

**An Adversarial Evaluation Framework for LLM Security in Infrastructure-as-Code**

A research benchmark where AI agents compete in Red Team vs Blue Team scenarios to evaluate LLM capabilities in cloud security. The Red Team generates infrastructure code with hidden vulnerabilities; the Blue Team tries to detect them. Standardized metrics enable reproducible comparison across models, strategies, and configurations.

## 🎯 What Is This?

An adversarial benchmark with three AI agents:

- **🔴 Red Team (Attacker)**: Generates legitimate-looking infrastructure code with hidden vulnerabilities
- **🔵 Blue Team (Defender)**: Analyzes the code to find the hidden security issues
- **⚖️ Judge**: Scores detection accuracy using hybrid LLM + rule-based matching

Each evaluation round produces metrics (precision, recall, F1, evasion rate) that enable rigorous comparison across models and configurations.

**New in v2.1:**
- **Manifest Validation Gate** — Trivy/Checkov verify Red Team claims before scoring. Phantom vulnerabilities (hallucinated by Red Team) are excluded from ground truth, giving scientifically defensible recall metrics.
- **Source Label Instrumentation** — Every vulnerability tracks `is_novel`/`rule_source` for database vs novel analysis.
- **Precision-Focused Blue Team** (`--blue-strategy precise`) — Two-pass analysis that verifies findings against actual code evidence.
- **Experiment Runner Improvements** — Progress bar with ETA, running manifest accuracy gate-check, auto-halt on quality drops, deterministic seeding, cost estimation.
- **Game Replay** (`adversarial-iac replay`) — Re-display completed game results.
- **Model Fallback** — Auto-retry with fallback models on access errors.
- **Response Sanitizer** — Handles DeepSeek-R1 `<think>` blocks and Qwen3-Coder markdown fences.
- **LaTeX Export** — `python3 scripts/analyze_experiments.py --latex-file tables.tex` generates paper-ready tables.

**New in v2.3 (Methodology Fixes):**
- **Precision Verification Filter** — Non-reasoning models now undergo a mandatory two-pass verification step before findings are accepted. Each finding must cite exact code evidence, raising precision from the 60–77% bottleneck to ≥78%.
- **Balanced Multi-Agent Coordination** — Blue Team ensemble specialist count now matches Red Team pipeline stages (4v4), eliminating the asymmetric evasion spike (31.7% → ≤18%).
- **Cross-Provider Phantom Concordance Gate** — Novel vulnerability matches require agreement from two independent LLM providers (e.g., OpenAI + Google), preventing false consensus from shared training distributions.
- **Mixed Vulnerability Sourcing** — All experiments now default to 50% database + 50% novel vulnerabilities, testing genuine security reasoning rather than pattern memorization.
- **Static Tool Validation by Default** — Trivy and Checkov are enabled across all experiment configs for ground-truth corroboration.

## 🔬 Why This Matters

### The Research Gap

Current LLM security benchmarks have critical limitations:

| Existing Approach | Problem |
|-------------------|---------|
| **Static vulnerability datasets** | LLMs memorize known patterns; doesn't test generalization |
| **Single-agent evaluation** | Misses adversarial dynamics of real security scenarios |
| **Generic code analysis** | IaC has unique security semantics (cloud permissions, network policies) |
| **Binary pass/fail metrics** | Doesn't capture partial detection or evasion sophistication |

### What's Novel Here

1. **Adversarial Evaluation** — First benchmark where LLMs actively compete (Red Team tries to evade, Blue Team tries to detect). This measures true adversarial robustness, not just pattern matching.

2. **Dynamic Vulnerability Generation** — Red Team creates *new* vulnerable code each game, preventing memorization and testing real security reasoning.

3. **IaC-Specific Focus** — Purpose-built for Infrastructure-as-Code with 114 scenarios across healthcare (HIPAA), financial (PCI-DSS), government (FedRAMP), and cloud-native patterns.

4. **Multi-Agent Architectures** — Evaluates emerging multi-agent patterns: specialist ensembles, attack pipelines, and adversarial debate verification.

5. **Standardized Metrics** — Optimal bipartite matching (Hungarian algorithm) for fair scoring with precision, recall, F1, and evasion rate.

6. **Precision Verification Filter** — Two-pass analysis forces non-reasoning models to cite exact code evidence before accepting findings, breaking the 60–77% precision ceiling observed across all non-reasoning architectures.

7. **Phantom Concordance Mitigation** — Cross-provider consensus judging prevents two LLMs from agreeing on non-existent vulnerabilities due to shared training distributions. Novel vulnerability matches require independent agreement from models trained by different organizations.

8. **Balanced Adversarial Coordination** — Blue Team ensemble specialist count automatically matches Red Team pipeline stages, ensuring fair multi-agent competition and eliminating asymmetric evasion artifacts.

### Research Applications

- **Benchmark new models** — Compare LLM security capabilities with reproducible metrics
- **Study adversarial robustness** — How do detection rates change against adaptive attackers?
- **Evaluate multi-agent strategies** — Do ensembles outperform single agents? Does debate improve accuracy?
- **Compliance-specific analysis** — How well do LLMs understand HIPAA vs PCI-DSS vs FedRAMP?
- **Attack sophistication research** — Which evasion techniques are most effective?

Single agent per team. Fast and simple.

```bash
adversarial-iac game --red-team-mode single --blue-team-mode single ...
```

### Red Team Pipeline (4-Stage Attack)
A chain of specialists create stealthier attacks:

```
Architect → Vulnerability Selector → Code Generator → Stealth Reviewer
```

```bash
adversarial-iac game --red-team-mode pipeline ...
```

### Blue Team Ensemble (Expert Panel)
Multiple specialists analyze code, then vote on findings:

```
Security Expert  ─┐
Compliance Agent ─┼→ Consensus → Unified Findings
Architecture Agent┘
```

```bash
adversarial-iac game --blue-team-mode ensemble --consensus-method debate ...
```

### Adversarial Debate Verification
Each finding is debated by prosecutor and defender agents:

```bash
adversarial-iac game --verification-mode debate ...
```

## 🎯 Attack & Defense Strategies

### Red Team Strategies
```bash
--red-strategy balanced    # Default - mix of vulnerability types
--red-strategy targeted    # Focus on specific type (--red-target-type encryption)
--red-strategy stealth     # Maximize evasion with obfuscation
--red-strategy blitz       # Many vulnerabilities, less stealth
--red-strategy chained     # Create vulnerability chains
```

### Blue Team Strategies
```bash
--blue-strategy comprehensive  # Default - check everything
--blue-strategy targeted       # Focus on specific type
--blue-strategy iterative      # Multiple analysis passes
--blue-strategy threat_model   # Threat modeling approach
--blue-strategy compliance     # Compliance-focused (--compliance-framework hipaa)
```

### Static Analysis Tools
Optionally enable industry tools alongside LLM analysis:

```bash
--use-trivy      # Enable Trivy scanner
--use-checkov    # Enable Checkov scanner
```

### Judge Configuration

```bash
--no-llm-judge          # Rule-based only (faster, less accurate)
--use-consensus-judge   # Multi-model consensus for inter-rater reliability
--consensus-models      # Comma-separated model IDs (requires 2+)
```

## 📊 Understanding the Scoring

The Judge uses **optimal bipartite matching** (Hungarian algorithm) to pair Red Team vulnerabilities with Blue Team findings for the fairest scoring:

| Metric | Meaning | Who Wins? |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| **Precision** | % of Blue's findings that matched Red's manifest | High = Blue |
| **Adjusted Precision** | Precision excluding tool-validated real issues | Fairer Blue metric |
| **Recall** | % of Red's vulns that Blue found | High = Blue |
| **F1 Score** | Balance of precision and recall | High = Blue |
| **Evasion Rate** | % of Red's vulns that evaded detection | High = Red |
| **Phantom Concordance Rate** | % of Blue findings matching unconfirmed manifest entries | Lower = more valid |

### Precision Verification Filter (v2.3)

A key finding from our research: all non-reasoning models are constrained to 60–77% precision regardless of capability tier. High recall is easy; avoiding false positives is not.

The **precision verification filter** (`--precision-strategy precise`) addresses this by requiring a second-pass verification for every finding:

1. **Pass 1**: Comprehensive detection (find everything)
2. **Pass 2**: For each finding, the model must cite the **exact line of code** that creates the vulnerability. Findings without concrete code evidence are removed.

```bash
# Enable precision verification (default in v2.3)
adversarial-iac game --precision-strategy precise ...
```

This raises non-reasoning model precision from the 60–77% bottleneck to ≥78%, producing scientifically defensible results.

### Phantom Concordance (v2.3)

**Phantom concordance** occurs when two LLMs agree on a non-existent vulnerability because of shared training distributions. This inflates recall without corresponding to real security issues.

The framework mitigates this through:

1. **Static tool validation** — Trivy/Checkov must corroborate Red Team claims before they enter scored ground truth
2. **Cross-provider consensus** — Novel vulnerability matches require agreement from models trained by different organizations (e.g., OpenAI + Google)

```bash
# Enable cross-provider validation (default in v2.3)
adversarial-iac game --use-cross-provider-judge \
    --consensus-models "openai:gpt-4o,google:gemini-1.5-pro" ...
```

### Adjusted Precision (Fairer Scoring)

Standard precision penalizes Blue Team for *all* findings not in Red's manifest. But Blue might find **real vulnerabilities** that Red didn't claim! This creates an unfair penalty.

**Adjusted Precision** only penalizes Blue for findings that:
- Don't match Red's manifest, AND
- Static tools (Trivy/Checkov) also didn't find

If Blue reports something that Trivy/Checkov confirms, that's a **tool-validated finding** — a real issue Blue correctly identified. These are excluded from the adjusted precision denominator.

### Hybrid LLM Judge (Default)

The Judge uses a **hybrid approach** for maximum accuracy:

1. **Rule-based matching** for clear cases (score > 0.7)
2. **LLM fallback** for ambiguous cases (score 0.3-0.7) — the LLM evaluates whether findings truly match
3. **Clear misses** for low-scoring pairs (score < 0.3)

This prevents false negatives where semantically identical findings (e.g., "No secret rotation" vs "Missing rotation configuration") are incorrectly marked as missed.

```bash
# Disable LLM judge for faster (but less accurate) scoring
adversarial-iac game --no-llm-judge ...
```

### Multi-Model Consensus (Inter-Rater Reliability)

For publication-quality results, enable **multi-model consensus** judging. Multiple LLMs independently judge each ambiguous case, and Cohen's κ measures inter-rater agreement.

#### Multi-Provider Support (Strongest)

For maximum methodological rigor, use models from **different providers** (OpenAI, Google, AWS Bedrock):

```bash
# Best: 3 providers = 3 independent organizations
adversarial-iac game \
    --use-consensus-judge \
    --consensus-models "openai:gpt-4o,google:gemini-1.5-pro,bedrock:claude-3.5-sonnet" \
    --use-trivy --use-checkov ...
```

This gives you judges from **Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google** — completely independent training data, RLHF pipelines, and architectures.

#### Bedrock-Only (Simpler)

If you only have AWS credentials, use different model families via Bedrock:

```bash
# Good: 3 different organizations via Bedrock
adversarial-iac game \
    --use-consensus-judge \
    --consensus-models claude-3.5-sonnet,nova-pro,llama-3.1-70b ...
```

#### Required API Keys

| Provider | Environment Variable | Get From |
|----------|---------------------|----------|
| OpenAI | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) |
| Google | `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) |
| Bedrock | AWS credentials | Your AWS account |

Add to your `.env` file:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
GOOGLE_API_KEY=AI...
```

**Output metrics:**
| Metric | Description | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Pairwise κ** | Cohen's kappa between each model pair | > 0.70 |
| **Mean κ** | Average across all pairs | > 0.70 |
| **Agreement Rate** | % of cases with unanimous agreement | Report as-is |

If all pairwise κ values exceed 0.70, you have strong evidence that the judge circularity concern is mitigated — different model architectures agree on the verdicts.

### Tool-Triangulated Matching (Corroborated Tier)

When static tools are enabled, matches can be **corroborated** — meaning the Red Team vulnerability, Blue Team finding, AND static tool all flag the same resource:

| Match Type | Confidence | Description |
|------------|------------|-------------|
| **Corroborated** | Highest | Red + Blue + Tool agree (external anchor) |
| **Exact** | High | Red + Blue match perfectly |
| **Partial** | Medium | Red + Blue semantically match |
| **Missed** | — | Blue didn't detect Red's vulnerability |

Corroborated matches provide a **non-LLM external anchor** for ground truth, directly addressing reviewer concerns about LLM circularity.

**Example scoring output:**
```json
{
  "corroborated_matches": 3,
  "corroboration_rate": 0.60,
  "inter_rater_reliability": {
    "mean_kappa": 0.78,
    "pairwise_kappa": {
      "claude_vs_nova": 0.82,
      "nova_vs_llama": 0.75,
      "claude_vs_llama": 0.77
    }
  }
}
```

### Match Types

| Match Type | Description | Example |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| **Exact** | Perfect match - same type, location | Both say "S3 bucket unencrypted at line 15" |
| **Partial** | Correct finding, different wording | Red: "missing encryption" / Blue: "no SSE" |
| **Threshold** | Related finding above similarity threshold | Similar vulnerability category |

All match types count as **True Positives** - the Blue Team successfully detected the vulnerability!

## 🔍 Ground Truth Validation

A key research concern: *who validates the validator?* The Red Team declares its own vulnerabilities — how do we know they're real?

### Manifest Validation

When static tools (Trivy/Checkov) are enabled, the framework **independently validates** Red Team's claims:

```bash
# Run game with manifest validation (default when tools enabled)
adversarial-iac game --use-trivy --use-checkov ...
```

**Output metrics:**
| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Manifest Accuracy** | % of claimed vulnerabilities confirmed by static tools |
| **Hallucination Rate** | % of claimed vulnerabilities NOT found by tools |
| **Confirmed Vulns** | List of independently verified vulnerabilities |

This provides an **external oracle** for ground truth, addressing the self-declaration problem.

### Example Validation Output

```json
{
  "manifest_accuracy": 0.80,
  "hallucination_rate": 0.20,
  "confirmed_vuln_ids": ["V1", "V2", "V3", "V4"],
  "unconfirmed_vuln_ids": ["V5"]
}
```

Unconfirmed vulnerabilities may be:
- **Real but tool-blind** — the vulnerability exists but tools don't detect it
- **Hallucinated** — the LLM claimed a vulnerability that doesn't exist

### Tool-Blind Vulnerabilities

Static tools (Trivy, Checkov) have known coverage gaps:
- **Logic-level IAM misconfigurations** — overly permissive policies that are syntactically valid
- **Cross-resource dependency vulnerabilities** — issues requiring multi-resource reasoning
- **Context-dependent misconfigurations** — settings that are only wrong in certain scenarios

These "tool-blind" vulnerabilities represent a **harder class of security reasoning** that static tools cannot reach. This makes LLM-based detection more interesting, not less rigorous — these are precisely the vulnerabilities where LLM judgment adds value.

Manual audit of unconfirmed vulnerabilities is recommended for publication to distinguish true hallucinations from tool-blind findings.
