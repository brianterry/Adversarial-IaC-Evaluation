# E0: Validation/Smoke Test
# Purpose: Quick validation that experiment infrastructure works
# Use this to test before running full experiments
#
# Total games: 6 (1 model × 3 difficulties × 2 scenarios × 1 repetition)
# Estimated runtime: 10-15 minutes

  Quick smoke test to validate:
    1. Experiment runner works correctly
    2. All new parameters are passed through
    3. Results are saved properly
  
  Run this before committing to longer experiments.
