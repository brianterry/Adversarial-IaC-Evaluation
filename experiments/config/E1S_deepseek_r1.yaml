description: |
  Reasoning-specialized supplementary condition parallel to E1-S-Q (Qwen3-Coder).
  Tests whether explicit chain-of-thought reasoning improves IaC vulnerability
  detection at hard difficulty beyond what general frontier models achieve.

  Hypothesis: DeepSeek-R1's reasoning specialization may improve detection of
  complex multi-step vulnerabilities (chained IAM escalation, cross-resource
  misconfigurations) but may not outperform on simple pattern-matching tasks
  (missing encryption flags, disabled logging) where reasoning overhead adds
  no value.

  Compare results against:
    - Claude 3.5 Sonnet hard-difficulty baseline (from E1)
    - Qwen3-Coder hard-difficulty results (from E1-S-Q)
  Report all three in a single subsidiary Table in §4.1.

# ── Expected analysis ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Subsidiary Table in §4.1 (all three hard-difficulty supplementary results):
#
# | Model            | Tier           | Hard Recall | Hard F1 | Hard Evasion |
# |------------------|----------------|-------------|---------|--------------|
# | Sonnet 3.5       | Frontier       | [from E1]   | [E1]    | [E1]         |
# | DeepSeek-R1      | Reasoning      | —           | —       | —            |
# | Qwen3-Coder-30B  | Code-Spec      | [from E1-S-Q] | [E1-S-Q] | [E1-S-Q] |
#
# Interpretation:
#   - If DeepSeek-R1 ≈ Sonnet: reasoning specialization provides no detection advantage
#   - If DeepSeek-R1 > Sonnet: explicit reasoning aids IaC vulnerability detection
#   - Compare DeepSeek vs Qwen: does reasoning or code specialization help more?
