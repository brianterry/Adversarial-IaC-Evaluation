# Adversarial Debate Verification

Validate findings through structured debate.

## Process

For each Blue Team finding:

1. **Prosecutor** argues it's a real vulnerability
2. **Defender** argues it's a false positive
3. **Judge** renders final verdict

## Usage

```bash
adversarial-iac game \
    --verification-mode debate
```
